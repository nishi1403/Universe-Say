      <h2>Comet: A Celestial Wanderer</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Comets are icy celestial bodies that orbit the Sun and are often
        characterized by their bright comas and long, glowing tails. They
        originate from the outer regions of the solar system and become visible
        as they approach the Sun, offering spectacular views and valuable
        scientific insights.
      </p>
      <h3>Structure and Composition</h3>
      Comets are composed of a nucleus, coma, and tail:<br />
      <b>1.Nucleus: </b> The solid, central part of a comet, typically a few
      kilometers in diameter. It consists of rock, dust, water ice, and frozen
      gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and ammonia.
      <br />
      <b>2.Coma:</b>
      A cloud of gas and dust that forms around the nucleus when the comet
      approaches the Sun. The heat causes the ices to sublimate, releasing gas
      and dust into space.

      <br />
      <b>3.Tail: </b>
      Comets have two types of tails: the ion (gas) tail and the dust tail. The
      ion tail, composed of charged particles, always points directly away from
      the Sun due to the solar wind, while the dust tail, consisting of small
      solid particles, follows the comet's orbit and curves away from the Sun.

      <br />
      <h3>Origin and Types</h3>
      Comets originate from two main regions in the solar system:
      <br />
      <b>1.Kuiper Belt: </b>A region beyond Neptune's orbit, containing
      short-period comets with orbits that take less than 200 years to complete.
      <br />
      <b>2.Oort Cloud:</b>A distant spherical shell surrounding the solar
      system, believed to be the source of long-period comets with orbits that
      can take thousands to millions of years to complete. <br />Comets are
      classified based on their orbital periods:
      <br />
      <b>Short-period comets: </b> Orbits lasting less than 200 years.
      <br />
      <b>Long-period comets: </b>Orbits extending over 200 years.
      <br />
      <b>Single-apparition comets:</b>Comets that have parabolic or hyperbolic
      trajectories, passing through the inner solar system once before leaving
      permanently.

      <h3>Famous Comets</h3>
      Several comets have gained fame due to their visibility and scientific
      importance:
      <br />
      <b>Halley's Comet:</b> Perhaps the most famous comet, visible from Earth
      every 76 years. It has been observed since ancient times and was the first
      comet identified as periodic.
      <br />
      <b>Comet Hale-Bopp:</b>Discovered in 1995, it was one of the brightest
      comets of the 20th century, visible to the naked eye for 18 months.
      <br />
      <b>Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9: </b>Known for its spectacular collision with
      Jupiter in 1994, providing valuable data on both the comet and the gas
      giant's atmosphere.
      <br />
      <h3>Scientific Importance</h3>
      <p>
        Comets are considered "fossils" of the early solar system, preserving
        materials from its formation. Studying their composition and behavior
        helps scientists understand the conditions and processes that shaped our
        planetary system. Comets may have also played a role in delivering water
        and organic compounds to Earth, contributing to the development of life.
      </p>
      <h3>Space Missions</h3>
      Several missions have been launched to study comets up close:<br />
      <b>Giotto:</b>ESA's mission that provided the first close-up images of a
      comet nucleus (Halley's Comet) in 1986.
      <br />
      <b>Stardust:</b>NASA's mission that collected samples from Comet Wild 2
      and returned them to Earth in 2006.
      <br />
      <b>Rosetta: </b> ESA's groundbreaking mission that orbited Comet
      67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and deployed the Philae lander in 2014,
      providing detailed data on the comet's composition and structure.
      <br />
      <h3>Cultural Significance</h3>
      <p>
        Comets have been observed and recorded by humans for millennia, often
        regarded with awe and superstition. They have appeared in historical
        records, literature, and art, symbolizing omens, divine messages, or
        harbingers of change.
