      <h2>Meteor: A Celestial Phenomenon</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        A meteor, often referred to as a "shooting star" or "falling star," is a
        small fragment of a meteoroid or asteroid that burns up upon entering
        the Earth's atmosphere. This luminous event occurs when the meteor
        travels at high speeds through the atmosphere, creating a bright streak
        of light that can be observed from the ground.
      </p>
      <h3>Origin and Composition</h3>
      <p>
        Meteors originate from meteoroids, which are small rocky or metallic
        bodies in space. These meteoroids can be fragments of comets, asteroids,
        or other celestial bodies. When a meteoroid enters the Earth's
        atmosphere and vaporizes, the resulting phenomenon is called a meteor.
        If the meteoroid survives its passage through the atmosphere and lands
        on Earth's surface, it is termed a meteorite.
      </p>
      <h3>Meteor Showers</h3>
      <p>
        Meteor showers are events where multiple meteors are observed to radiate
        from a specific point in the sky, called the radiant. These showers
        occur when the Earth passes through the debris trail left by a comet.
        Some well-known meteor showers include:
      </p>
      <b>Perseids:</b>Originating from the comet Swift-Tuttle, observed in
      August.
      <br />
      <b>Leonids:</b>Linked to comet Tempel-Tuttle, visible in November.
      <br />
      <b>Geminids: </b> Associated with the asteroid 3200 Phaethon, occurring in
      December.
      <br />
      <p>
        During a meteor shower, observers can witness dozens or even hundreds of
        meteors per hour under optimal conditions.
      </p>
      <h3>Process of Meteor Formation</h3>
      <b>1.Entry:</b>A meteoroid enters the Earth's atmosphere at high velocity,
      typically between 11 and 72 kilometers per second.
      <br />
      <b>2.Friction:</b>The friction with atmospheric particles causes the
      meteoroid to heat up and begin to glow, forming a meteor.
      <br />
      <b>3.Ablation:</b>As it descends, the meteoroid loses mass through
      ablation, where the surface material vaporizes.
      <br />
      <b>4.Light Emission: </b>The intense heat and rapid oxidation produce the
      characteristic bright streak of light.
      <br />
      <b>5.Disintegration or Landing:</b>Smaller meteoroids often disintegrate
      completely, while larger ones may survive and reach the Earth's surface as
      meteorites.
      <br />
      <h3>Scientific Importance</h3>
      <p>
        Meteors and meteorites provide valuable scientific information about the
        early solar system. By studying these objects, scientists can gain
        insights into the composition, structure, and history of celestial
        bodies. Meteorites, in particular, are prized for their relatively
        unchanged state since the formation of the solar system, making them
        important for understanding planetary formation and evolution.
      </p>
      <h3>Observation and Safety</h3>
      <p>
        Meteor observation can be a rewarding experience for amateur astronomers
        and the general public. To observe a meteor shower, it is best to find a
        dark, clear sky away from city lights. Peak viewing times are usually
        after midnight, when the sky is darkest.
      </p>

      <p>
        While meteors pose no threat as they typically burn up in the
        atmosphere, larger meteoroids that become meteorites can pose a risk if
        they impact populated areas. However, such events are rare.
      </p>
      <h3>Cultural Significance</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout history, meteors have held various cultural significances.
        They have been considered omens, messages from gods, or even harbingers
        of significant events. Today, they continue to inspire wonder and
        curiosity about the universe.
