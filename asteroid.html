      <h2>Asteroid: A Comprehensive Overview</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Asteroids are rocky objects orbiting the Sun, primarily found in the
        asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Unlike planets, asteroids are
        much smaller and do not have atmospheres. They are considered remnants
        from the early solar system, providing valuable insights into its
        formation and evolution.
      </p>
      <h3>Origin and Composition</h3>
      <p>
        Asteroids are believed to be leftover building blocks from the formation
        of the solar system around 4.6 billion years ago. They are composed of
        various types of rock and metal, with some containing carbon compounds
        and even water. The diversity in their composition reflects the
        different conditions and processes that occurred in the early solar
        system.
      </p>
      <h3>Classification</h3>
      Asteroids are classified based on their location and composition:
      <br />
      <b>1.Main Belt Asteroids: </b>
      These are located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Examples
      include Ceres, the largest asteroid, and Vesta.
      <br />
      <b>2.Trojans:</b>
      These asteroids share an orbit with a larger planet, like Jupiter, and are
      found in the Lagrange points.
      <br />
      <b>3.Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs): </b>
      These have orbits that bring them close to Earth's orbit. Some NEAs pose a
      potential impact risk to Earth.
      <br />
      Compositionally, asteroids are classified into three main types:<br />
      <b>C-type (Carbonaceous): </b>Rich in carbon, these are the most common
      and oldest asteroids.<br />
      <b>S-type (Silicaceous): </b> Made up of silicate rocks and metals.<br />
      <b>M-type (Metallic): </b> Comprised primarily of metallic iron and
      nickel.<br />
      <h3>Scientific Importance</h3>
      <p>
        Asteroids hold clues to the early solar system's conditions and
        processes. Studying their composition and structure helps scientists
        understand planetary formation and the distribution of materials in the
        solar system. Missions like NASA's OSIRIS-REx, which visited the
        asteroid Bennu, aim to return samples to Earth for detailed analysis.
      </p>
      <h3>Potential Threats and Benefits</h3>
      <p>
        Asteroids can pose a threat to Earth if they collide with our planet.
        Large impacts have the potential to cause significant damage, and
        monitoring programs track potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs).
        However, asteroids also present potential benefits, such as mining for
        valuable minerals and metals. Some asteroids contain high concentrations
        of rare elements like platinum, making them targets for future space
        mining ventures.
      </p>
      <h3>Notable Asteroids and Missions</h3>
      <b>Ceres:</b>The largest asteroid and the first to be discovered, now
      classified as a dwarf planet.
      <br />
      <b>Vesta:</b>Known for its bright surface and differentiated interior,
      studied extensively by NASA's Dawn mission.
      <br />
      <b>Bennu: </b>The target of NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission, which aims to
      return samples to Earth.
      <br />
      Other notable missions include Japan's Hayabusa and Hayabusa2, which have
      successfully returned samples from asteroids Itokawa and Ryugu,
      respectively.
      <h3>Cultural and Historical Significance</h3>
      <p>
        Asteroids have fascinated humans for centuries, featuring in mythology,
        literature, and popular culture. They were first discovered in the early
        19th century, with Ceres being the first identified in 1801. Since then,
        thousands of asteroids have been cataloged, and their study has become a
        significant aspect of planetary science.
